# Drug Inventory and Supply Chain Management System

This project is a decentralized Drug Supply Chain Management System built using React for the frontend, Python (Flask) for the backend, and Solidity on the Ethereum blockchain. The system ensures transparency, traceability, and security in the supply chain of pharmaceutical drugs.

# Introduction
The pharmaceutical industry faces significant challenges related to drug inventory and supply chain management. Issues such as counterfeit medicines, inventory discrepancies, and inefficient tracking methods can lead to severe consequences for public health and business integrity. Our project aims to address these challenges by developing an advanced drug inventory management system that leverages modern technologies to ensure transparency, accuracy, and efficiency throughout the supply chain.
